We share here CRISPRepi. CRISPRepi is a tool used to predict CRISPR/Cas9 on-target efficiency. CRISPRepi is a multi-layered preceptron, i.e. a cascade of fully connected layers of 64,
8 neurons, terminating with a final neuron, which outputs the on-target efficiency. The input is a fixed RNA sequence of 32nt length and four possible epigenetic marks: Chromatin accessibility, CTCF binding, H3K4me3 and DNA methylation.
